### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

-   #### First Time Visitor Goals

    1. Understand the main purpose of the site:

        1. Upon entering the site, users are greeted with a page title, hero image, and an inspirational quote to convey the main purpose of the site. 
        2. An easily readable navigation bar allows the user to explore all available content with just one click, or, for users on devices with small screen sizes, two taps via the dropdown menu.

    2. Easily navigate through the site:

        1. Each page contains a consistent nav bar with links to all pages of the site.
        2. The title of the page on the top, also consistent across all sites, always leads back to the home page.
        3. On the home and contact pages, after signing up for the newsletter and submitting a form respectively, the page refreshes to the respective same page with a clean form.

    3. Get inspired about traveling:

        1. A hero image and an inspiring quote on the home page awake a sense of wanderlust.
        2. The heavy use of images on the site create a desire to see more and inspire the user to consider the destinations for their own journeys.

-   #### Returning Visitor Goals

    1. View and get inspired about trips by pictures:

        1. The gallery page clearly separates various picture gallerys based on their location.
        2. The interactive gallery allows the user to either lean back and watch the pictures change by itself or to take action and go through the pictures at their own speed.

    2. Read and get inspired about trips by blog posts:

        1. The blog page contains various blog posts about one trip, clearly structured by day.
        2. These blog posts are introduced by a short text to explain the background and purpose of the trip.
        3. The user is inspired to await more context through the "Stay tuned" message at the bottom of the page.

    3. Find a way to get in touch with the developer of the site:

        1. The nav bar contains a clearly named link to the Contact page, which leads to a contact form with a subject drop-down menu.
        2. Alternatively, the user can scroll to the bottom of any page to a link to the Contact page (on medium and larger devices only).

    4. Find social media links of the developer of the site:

        1. In the footer which is consistent on each page contains users can find links to the main social media pages of the developer on all screen sizes.

        1. The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can easily click the gallery link.

    2. Read blog posts that may have been added since the last visit

        1. The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can easily click the blog link.

    3. Sign up to the newsletter to het notified about updates:

### Further Testing

-   The website was tested on Google Chrome, Firefox and Microsoft Edge browsers.
-   The website was viewed on a desktop, a laptop, and on HonorView 20 (Android).
-   Manual testing using the chrome web developer tool was done to ensure the intended functionality and responsiveness work on devices of all sizes.
-   Manual testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.
-   Friends and family members were asked to review the site to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

### Known Bugs

-   On the gallery page, pictures in portrait and landscape orientation appear in different sizes, causing the general content of the page to jump around when the carousel moves on to the next slide.
    -   This may cause the user to have to scroll back to center the pictures they were viewing, or to have to move the mouse pointer back to the "next slide" indicator.

### Planned Features

-   General:
    -   Turn page title "Ra's Travel Blog" into a text overlay over the hero image as background
    -   Add several more pages: 
        -   About: introduction to the developer
        -   Traveling Solo: tips for safe solo traveling, especially for women, trans and non-binary people
        -   Gear and Equipment: tips and recommendations for useful gear and equipment
        -   Reviews: reviews of visited places

-   Gallery:
    - At the top of the page, add a filter function for the user to select pictures for a specific trip or destination
    - Make pictures clickable, and let them increase in size into a nearly full screen overlay upon clicking
    - Add more slides to existing carousels and more carousels for more destinations

-   Blog:
    - At the top of the page, add a filter function for the user to select pictures for a specific trip or destination
    - Add more content, first for other trips already in the gallery, then for more trips to be added
