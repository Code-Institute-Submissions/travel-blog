                    <h5>Kilimanjaro Day #3</h5>
                    <p class="blog-text">Day #3 of the climb. We left Shira Cave Camp early in the morning again with an amazing view of Mount Meru behind us. Then it went up, 
                    up, up into the clouds, sometimes quite literally. Always pole, pole, of course - this is Swahili for slowly, slowly and pretty much the first word one 
                    learns in this language. This day was all about acclimatization of our bodies to the increasing altitude. Our first stop would therefore be Lava Tower, 
                    a massive volcanic rock tower at an altitude of 4,600 m. I was in good spirits and enjoyed the ever decreasing flora around us on our way up there. 
                    When we eventually reached Lava Tower Camp, it was the first and luckily only time I really felt the altitude though. I was feeling nauseated and barely 
                    managed to eat at the lunch that had been prepared for us. The whole point of acclimatization is to give the body time to get used to the altitude. 
                    Therefore, after lunch at Lava Tower Camp, it was about going a bit further down again. The path we followed allowed for some breathtaking views of 
                    the mountain and with decreasing altitude the flora again, too. Remember giant groundsels? Eventually, we were able to see Barranco Camp and on 
                    the left, hidden behind the clouds, the famous Barranco Wall, that we would be tackling the next day.</p>

                    <h5>Kilimanjaro Day #2</h5>
                    <p class="blog-text">On the mountain you always get up early. It was a sunny morning and we had a clear view of Kilimanjaro's little brother Mount Meru 
                    (4,562 m). It was now steadily going upwards and we moved with a mix of walking and scrambling up the rock. The vegetation kept changing as we moved through
                    the heath into the moorland zone, from smaller trees to mainly bushes and the characteristic giant groundsels. In the afternoon we reached Shira Cave
                    Camp at 3,750 m. After arrival in the camp, some guides offered to show us Shira Cave and lead us to a higher point from where we had a good overview of the 
                    camp. There were also lots of stone stacks, which can be seen quite often on the mountain. Towards the evening the clouds disappeared 
                    and we had a clear view of Kilimanjaro. After dinner, I found myself a comfy rock an watched Mount Meru as it was slowly being engulfed in the light of the
                    setting sun.</p>

                    <p class="blog-text">We climbed the Machame route and therefore started at Machame Gate. We spent the first day climbing through a mild climate and 
                    surrounded by lush rainforest. The incline was moderate and with increasing altitude the size of the trees around us begun to decrease. We reached camp 
                    in the late afternoon. Upon arrival at each camp, we were required to check in at a hut located on the camping ground. With the sun vanishing first 
                    behind clouds and eventually behind the horizon, it got increasingly cold, so after check in and dinner we headed straight to our tents.</p>
